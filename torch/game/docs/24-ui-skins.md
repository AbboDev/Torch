# Game UI skins core

Make a game's menus look like a mobile game's, not a web page's. A skin is a whole `ui` theme in one material and one
colour: buttons on a 3D lip that press down into it, jelly and candy gloss, glints, a shine that sweeps across, an
outline in the button's own hue, and chunky display-font captions with a thick stroke and an extruded drop — for the
buttons, the round icon buttons, windows and title bars, sliders, toggles, progress bars, checkboxes, radios, text
fields and lists alike. This pack is the core every skin shares; each look is its own `ui-skin-*` pack, so a game carries
the skins it composes and no others.

## When to use it

Any game with menus, a shop, a settings screen, a pause screen or HUD buttons that should look like a game rather than
a form. Compose `ui-skins`, then one or more skin packs after it, and choose one with `game.ui.theme`. For a look of
the game's own (a calm, flat or retro-computer one), define it with `game.ui.defineTheme` or load a
`phaser-ae-ui-theme` file (`ui`'s page); for meters (health, timers, XP) compose `bars`. 2D, screen space.

## Requires

`ui`, composed before it (and so `typography` and a WebGPU or WebGL2 backend). Each skin pack requires this one.

## API

```ts
// manifest: … typography, ui, ui-skins, ui-skin-candy
game.ui.theme = "candy"; // every widget, one material
game.ui.button({
  anchor: "center",
  h: 76,
  text: "PLAY",
  style: "good",
  icon: "play",
  onClick: start,
}); // sized to fit
game.ui.button({ h: 64, text: "Shop", style: "orange", icon: "cart" }); // any named colour is a style
game.ui.button({ h: 72, icon: "settings", style: "icon" }); // the round icon button
game.ui.label({
  anchor: "top",
  y: 120,
  w: 640,
  h: 140,
  text: "My Game",
  style: "heading",
}); // a title: grows with h
game.ui.pauseButton();
game.ui.muteButton(); // they wear `icon` already
game.skins.use({
  material: "candy",
  color: "pink",
  radius: "pill",
  name: "pink",
}); // remake it, live
```

**The skins**, one pack each:

| pack                  | theme         | look                                                                                                           | colour | font         |
| --------------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------ |
| `ui-skin-jelly`       | `jelly`       | two-tone face cut by a gloss band, dark outline in the hue, lip, glints, debossed caption                      | green  | Lilita One   |
| `ui-skin-candy`       | `candy`       | pill, white rim, jelly highlight, sweeping shine, white caption stroked and extruded                           | yellow | Luckiest Guy |
| `ui-skin-glossy`      | `glossy`      | glossy pill, dark outline, inset highlight and glints, white stroked caption                                   | blue   | Titan One    |
| `ui-skin-bubble`      | `bubble`      | sphere: dome highlight, bright inner ring, three-stop face; made for round buttons                             | orange | Baloo 2      |
| `ui-skin-block`       | `block`       | flat colour on a solid lip, no outline or gloss                                                                | teal   | Passion One  |
| `ui-skin-cartoon`     | `cartoon`     | comic: thick ink outline, hard offset shadow it jumps onto, cream windows                                      | yellow | Bangers      |
| `ui-skin-wood`        | `wood`        | planks, inner frame, cream caption; colours stain the wood                                                     | brown  | Lilita One   |
| `ui-skin-metal`       | `metal`       | brushed chrome, banded face, lit bevel, slow glint, engraved caption                                           | grey   | Orbitron     |
| `ui-skin-bezel`       | `bezel`       | glossy candy face in a polished chrome bezel (the trim: silver, or gold in yellow), dark line between          | pink   | Titan One    |
| `ui-skin-candystripe` | `candystripe` | pill, light tube outline, jelly highlight; cream windows in a wide candy-striped frame                         | purple | Chewy        |
| `ui-skin-timber`      | `timber`      | painted wood with real grain (requires `ui-texture-wood`), lighter rim, dark inner line, glossy orange accents | blue   | Lilita One   |

Each skin pack's manifest options make its theme: `name`, `color`, `surface` (the hue of the default windows, panels,
grooves and boxes; a skin that draws its own keeps them, and its page says which), `accent` (title
bars, slider fills, knobs, dots and selected rows; default the main colour), `trim` (a rim, bezel or frame the material
draws in a colour of its own: candy's white rim, bezel's chrome; materials with none ignore it), `radius`, `depth` (the
lip), `roles` (`good`, `warn`, `bad`, `flat` colours), `colors` (extra named colours) and `designHeight`.
`{ "id": "ui-skin-jelly", "options": { "color": "pink", "radius": "pill", "accent": "yellow" } }`.

**The styles every skin defines.** Buttons: `default` (the main colour), `good` (green), `warn` (orange), `bad` (red),
`flat` (grey), and one per named colour — `green red blue yellow orange purple pink teal grey brown`
(`UI_SKIN_COLORS`). `icon` is the round icon button. Then every other role a widget draws with: `dark` (window body),
`title` (its title bar), `panel`, `label`, `heading` (a title, which grows with the label's height from the
`designHeight` and shrinks to its width), `track fill knob` (slider, toggle, progress), `box tick dot`
(checkbox, radio), `field focus` (text), `row rowSelected scrollTrack scrollThumb` (lists). Each button has a hover, a
pressed look (down into its lip; a lipless one nudges down) and a disabled look (the same button in grey).

**The speech box.** Every skin theme also carries the `dialogue` section the `dialogue` pack reads from the active theme
(`game.ui.themeDef.dialogue`), so `game.dialogue.open({ lines })` with no preset wears the skin, with no `dialogue`
options and nothing to load. It is derived from the material, so it follows `accent` (the main colour unless one is
chosen), and `surface` where the material keeps the default window: the panel is the skin's `dark` window (a cartoon's cream window, a wood's planks, a candy stripe's
frame; its `contentInset`, `textColor` and `font` left off), `ink` is that window's text colour, `accent` is the
accent's face (the title bars' colour) for the nameplate, `nameInk` is white on it, or the accent's ink when the plate is
too light for white to reach 3:1, and `motif` is the plain `cinema` composition (a hairline in the accent; the window
supplies the look). The speech uses the skin's font. To change any of it, spread the theme:

```ts
const def = game.skins.make({ material: "candy", color: "pink" });
game.ui.defineTheme({
  ...def,
  dialogue: { ...def.dialogue, motif: "school", size: 30 },
});
```

`validateUiSkin` checks the section too, so a new skin pack's test covers it.

**`game.skins`** — make and switch skins from the composed materials at run time:

- `materials` — the composed materials' names.
- `make(spec)` → a `UiThemeDef` from `{ material, ...options }`; define it with `game.ui.defineTheme`. Throws when the
  material is not composed (naming the pack to add) or a colour does not parse.
- `use(spec)` — make it, define it (replacing a theme of the same name, live) and switch to it; returns its name.
- `style(material, color, overrides?)` → one button `UiStyle`: `game.ui.defineStyle('mint', game.skins.style('candy', '#3df0b0'))`.
- `palette(color)` → `{ face, faceTo, lip, ink, light, text }`.

**Helpers** (pure, importable by a game or a tool):

- `uiSkinPalette(color)` — the shades a colour is worked into. Darks lean warm on yellows and oranges (a yellow
  button's lip is orange and its outline brown); `text` is white, or the ink on a pale face.
- `uiSkinColor(c)` — a colour name or hex as `#rrggbb`; `uiSkinMix(a, b, t)`, `uiSkinAlpha(c, a)`, `uiSkinLighter(c, t?)`.
- `uiSkinFont(shape, scale?)` and `uiSkinPress(shape)` — a material's caption font and pressed look.
- `buildUiSkin(material, options?)` → `UiThemeDef`; `buildUiSkinStyle(material, color, overrides?, options?)` → `UiStyle`.
- `validateUiSkin(material, options?)` → the problems with a material, as sentences; `[]` when sound.
- `registerUiSkin(k, material, options?)` — a skin pack's attach: registers the material and its theme.

**Adding a skin.** A skin is a `UiSkinMaterialDef` — `name`, `look`, default `color` and `surface`, a `font` (a baked
GLB), caption `size`, `radius` and `depth` at the 64 px design height, an optional `iconRadius`, `trim` and `accent`, a
`button(palette, shape)` that returns one button style (the shape carries the resolved `trim`), and an optional
`surfaces(ctx)` that lays roles over the default windows and parts (the context carries the `main` and `accent`
palettes) — in its own `ui-skin-<name>` pack whose attach is `registerUiSkin(k, MATERIAL, options)`.
Its test is `assert.deepEqual(validateUiSkin(MATERIAL), [])` in its own colours and in others. Copy any skin pack. A
skin that draws a texture (`texture: 'wood'`) lists its texture pack in `requires` beside `ui-skins`, so a game that
composes the skin composes the texture: see `ui-skin-timber`. A skin with a wide window frame sets `contentInset` on
`dark` so a window's children stay clear of it: see `ui-skin-candystripe`.

## Options

None. The skins are options of their own packs (above).

## Limits

- A skin's font is 1–3 MB from the CDN, fetched when the skin is first chosen. Choose the skin before the first load
  and it loads under the loading screen, and `game.start()` waits for it; `await game.ui.ready()` waits for it later.
  Until it lands, captions draw in the generic family.
- The display fonts cover Latin, Greek and Cyrillic.
- The caption stroke and extrusion draw the text again behind itself (see `ui`'s Limits): fine for buttons and
  headings, wasteful on a label rewritten every frame.
- `designHeight` scales by height only. A button with a fixed width shrinks a long caption to fit (see `ui`), so a
  row of equal buttons may show captions at different sizes; leave the width off to have each fit its caption.
- A skin pack costs about half a kilobyte compressed; this core about three. Fonts are never bundled; a texture pack
  (for `ui-skin-timber`) generates its picture at startup, a few tens of milliseconds, and downloads nothing.
