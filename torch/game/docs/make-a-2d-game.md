# Make a 2D game

This page is the engine for a 2D game: sprites, pictures, text, backgrounds, input, motion, sound, collisions and
scenes. Import `game` from `./engine.js`; everything below is on it. The other pages in `docs/` are reference.

## A whole game

Rocks fall; the ship dodges them with the arrow keys or the pointer. Each part is explained below.

```ts
import { game, type Sprite } from "./engine.js";

const W = game.screen.width,
  H = game.screen.height;

// Pictures: painted once, by name, with the 2D canvas.
game.paint("ship", 48, 40, (ctx) => {
  const body = ctx.createLinearGradient(0, 0, 0, 40);
  body.addColorStop(0, "#9fe8ff");
  body.addColorStop(1, "#2a6cff");
  ctx.fillStyle = body;
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.moveTo(24, 0);
  ctx.lineTo(48, 40);
  ctx.lineTo(0, 40);
  ctx.closePath();
  ctx.fill();
});
game.paint("rock", 40, 40, (ctx) => {
  ctx.fillStyle = "#8a6a4a";
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.arc(20, 20, 18, 0, Math.PI * 2);
  ctx.fill();
  ctx.fillStyle = "#5a4430";
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.arc(14, 15, 5, 0, Math.PI * 2);
  ctx.fill();
});
game.sound.defineAll({
  hit: {
    type: "noise",
    duration: 0.4,
    filter: { type: "lowpass", freq: 1800, freqEnd: 200 },
    volume: 0.8,
  },
});

type Rock = { speed: number };

game.scenes.register({
  name: "play",
  enter() {
    game.background.gradient("#0b1030", "#3a2a6a");
    game.background.stars({ density: 0.6 });
    const ship = game.spawn({
      id: "ship",
      texture: "ship",
      x: W / 2,
      y: H - 80,
      layer: "world",
      tags: ["ship"],
    });
    const score = game.text("0", W / 2, 40, {
      size: 36,
      stroke: { color: "#000000", width: 2 },
    });
    let points = 0;

    game.every(0.6, () => {
      game.spawn({
        id: "rock",
        texture: "rock",
        x: game.rng.between(20, W - 20),
        y: -20,
        layer: "world",
        tags: ["rock"],
        data: { speed: game.rng.between(120, 260) },
      });
    });

    game.step("play", (dt) => {
      if (game.input.keyDown("ArrowLeft")) ship.x -= 300 * dt;
      if (game.input.keyDown("ArrowRight")) ship.x += 300 * dt;
      const p = game.input.pointer;
      if (p?.down) ship.x += (p.x - ship.x) * 0.2;
      ship.x = Math.max(24, Math.min(W - 24, ship.x));
      for (const rock of game.roster.tagged("rock") as Iterable<Sprite<Rock>>) {
        rock.y += rock.data.speed * dt;
        rock.rot += dt;
        if (rock.y > H + 40) {
          rock.destroy();
          points += 1;
          score.text = String(points);
        }
      }
    });

    game.collide.on("ship", "rock", () => {
      game.sound.play("hit");
      game.feel.shake(10, 0.4);
      game.scenes.go("over");
    });
  },
});

game.scenes.register({
  name: "over",
  enter() {
    game.background.color("#200a14");
    const title = game.text("Game over", W / 2, H / 2, {
      size: 64,
      font: "sans-bold",
      color: "#ff6a6a",
    });
    game.tween.from(
      title,
      { scale: 0.4, alpha: 0 },
      { duration: 0.4, ease: "easeOutBack" }
    );
    game.text("Space to play again", W / 2, H / 2 + 70, { size: 24 });
    game.step("over", () => {
      if (game.input.keyPressed("Space") || game.input.pointer?.pressed)
        game.scenes.go("play");
    });
  },
});

await game.start();
game.scenes.go("play");
```

## The screen

`game.screen.width` and `game.screen.height` are the game's size in pixels, whatever the window. Positions are in
the same units: (0, 0) is the top-left until the camera moves, `y` points down, and an object's `x, y` is its
**center**. Angles are radians.

The manifest's `screen` sets it: `{ "width": 720, "height": 1280, "fit": "letterbox", "background": "#10162a" }`.
`fit` is how the game meets the window: `letterbox` scales the whole screen to fit, with bars where the shapes
differ; `height` keeps the height and takes the width from the window, so a wider window sees more of the world
(read `game.screen.width`, never assume it); `fill` makes one game pixel one page pixel; `fixed` is exactly
`width` x `height` page pixels. `"pixelArt": true` keeps scaled pixels square and sharp.

## Two worlds

A 2D game is seen side-on or from above, and each is a world pack. `core-2d` composes the side-on one,
`world-side`: its layers are `'back'`, `'world'` and `'front'`, and depth within a layer is `z`. For a game seen
from above (a Zelda, a twin-stick shooter, a farm, a maze), name `world-topdown` in the manifest and it takes the
side-on world's place: its layers are `'floor'`, `'world'` and `'fx'`, and things on a layer draw back to front by
their feet, so a character walks behind a tree with nothing sorted by hand. Spawn with a layer the world has; a
spawn with no layer lands on the world's first. Either world can wrap its edges into a torus
(`"options": { "wrap": { "w": 1280, "h": 720 } }`): positions wrap, and collisions and the camera see across the seam.

## Pictures

Every picture has a name. Paint it once, before the scenes start (`art.ts` is the place), and every sprite of it is
`texture: 'name'`.

```ts
game.paint("coin", 32, 32, (ctx) => {
  ctx.fillStyle = "#ffd34d";
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.arc(16, 16, 14, 0, Math.PI * 2);
  ctx.fill();
  ctx.strokeStyle = "#b8860b";
  ctx.lineWidth = 3;
  ctx.stroke();
});
game.paint(
  "bird",
  40,
  30,
  (ctx, i) => {
    /* frame i of 4: wings up, level, down, level */
  },
  { frames: 4 }
);
game.pixels(
  "heart",
  [".RR.RR.", "RRRRRRR", ".RRRRR.", "..RRR..", "...R..."],
  { R: "#ff3355" },
  4
);
```

- `paint(name, width, height, draw, { frames })` draws with the ordinary canvas 2D context: paths, arcs, gradients,
  `shadowBlur` for glow, `globalCompositeOperation`, text. Draw in the picture's own units; it is drawn at twice that
  density, so it stays sharp on a high-density screen, and shows at `width` × `height`.
- With `frames`, `draw(ctx, i)` runs once per frame, each clipped to its own `width` × `height`: an animation, or a
  thing's states (a button up and down, a tile's variants).
- `pixels(name, rows, palette, scale)` is pixel art: one character per pixel, `.` (or any character not in the
  palette) is clear, each pixel `scale` units square. Set `"pixelArt": true` in the manifest's `screen` to keep
  scaled pixels square.
- Paint at the size the picture is shown. A big painting (a sky, a far hill line) is fine: it gets a texture of
  its own, as does anything once the shared one is full, so there is nothing to size. `'white'` is taken: it is the
  plain square a sprite with no picture shows.
- A file is a picture too, by the key `assets.json` gives it: `texture: 'hero'` shows it.

## Sprites

```ts
const ship = game.spawn({
  id: "ship",
  texture: "ship",
  x: 400,
  y: 300,
  layer: "world",
  tags: ["player"],
  data: { hp: 3 },
});
ship.x += 120 * dt;
ship.rot = Math.PI / 4;
ship.alpha = 0.5;
ship.tint = "#ff8080";
ship.visible = false;
ship.scale = 2; // or sx / sy for each axis; sx = -1 mirrors it
ship.texture = "ship-hurt"; // another picture; setTexture('bird', 2) picks a frame of one
heart.setFrame(1); // frame 1 of its own picture
ship.data.hp -= 1; // its own state, typed from the literal
ship.destroy(); // gone; ship.alive is false from now on
```

- A sprite is the size of its picture. Give `width` alone (or `height`) to resize it and keep its shape, both to
  stretch it, or `scale`.
- `layer`: `'world'` for the play, `'back'` behind it, `'front'` over it, `'hud'` for what stays on screen while the
  camera moves. With no layer a sprite goes on `'back'`. `z` orders sprites within a layer.
- `id` names it for inspect (`ship-1`, `ship-2` …). `tags` are how you find it and how collisions find it.
- Frames: `frame: 2` at spawn, or `bird.setFrame(2)` later, shows frame 2 of its picture (0 is the first): a button
  up and down, a heart full and empty. Animation: `anims: { flap: { strip: 'bird', fps: 10 } }` at spawn, then
  `bird.play('flap')`.
- Find sprites, rather than keeping your own lists: `game.roster.tagged('rock')`, `game.roster.near(x, y, radius)`,
  `game.roster.at(x, y)`.
- Name the type where you must: `Sprite` (from `./engine.js`), with its data, `Sprite<{ hp: number }>`. Leave what
  `spawn` returns inferred everywhere else. Declare a data shape with `type`, not `interface`.

## Text

```ts
const score = game.text("Score 0", W / 2, 40, {
  size: 32,
  color: "#ffffff",
  stroke: { color: "#000000", width: 2 },
});
score.text = `Score ${points}`;
game.text("Paused", W / 2, H / 2, {
  size: 72,
  font: "serif-bold",
  shadow: { color: "#00000099", x: 4, y: 4 },
});
game.text("Lives 3", 16, 16, { align: "left", baseline: "top" });
```

- `x, y` is the text's **center** unless `align` (`'left' | 'center' | 'right'`) or `baseline`
  (`'top' | 'middle' | 'bottom'`) say otherwise.
- `size` in pixels (default 24); `font` is `'sans'`, `'serif'` or `'mono'`, each with `-bold`. Colors are hex.
- `stroke` outlines the letters, up to about a twentieth of the size; `shadow` is a hard offset copy behind.
- Text sits on the `'hud'` layer, so it stays on screen; give `layer: 'world'` for text that moves with the world.
- Change `text`, `x`, `y`, `color`, `alpha`, `scale` or `visible` at any time, tween them, and `destroy()` it. An
  empty string shows nothing. `width` and `height` are its size once its font has arrived.

## Backgrounds

```ts
game.background.gradient("#1a2a6c", "#fdbb2d"); // top color, bottom color
game.background.color("#10162a"); // or one color
game.background.stars({ density: 0.8, twinkle: 1, drift: 0.2 }); // over the color or gradient
game.background.picture("sky", "cover"); // or a picture by name: 'cover', 'contain', 'stretch'
```

Set the background in each scene's `enter()`; a new scene starts with none. Set the color or gradient before the
stars. For scenery that scrolls with the camera, paint it and spawn it as a sprite on `'back'`.

## Graphics

For what changes as the game runs: trails, glows, a line to the target, a meter. One `game.graphics()` covers the
screen; draw on it and it shows from the next frame.

```ts
const fx = game.graphics({ layer: "front" });
game.step("trail", () => {
  fx.clear();
  fx.draw((ctx) => {
    ctx.strokeStyle = "#7fd4ff";
    ctx.lineWidth = 3;
    ctx.globalAlpha = 0.6;
    ctx.beginPath();
    ctx.moveTo(ship.x, ship.y);
    ctx.lineTo(target.x, target.y);
    ctx.stroke();
  });
});
```

It keeps what was drawn until `clear()`. `draw(ctx => …)` is the 2D context; `rect`, `line`, `circle`, `ring`,
`poly`, `fill` and `text` are short forms. It is one object on a layer, like a sprite: draw sprites with sprites,
and keep a graphics for what moves too freely to be one. `game.graphics({ width, height, x, y })` makes a smaller one.
On a world layer it stays where the camera started; when the camera moves, give it `layer: 'hud'` and draw at
`game.camera.toScreen(x, y)`.

## Input

```ts
if (game.input.keyDown("ArrowLeft")) ship.x -= speed * dt; // held
if (game.input.keyPressed("Space")) jump(); // went down this step
const p = game.input.pointer; // mouse, finger or pen, or null
if (p?.pressed) {
  const at = game.camera.toWorld(p.x, p.y);
  tapAt(at.x, at.y);
}
game.input.bind("fire", ["Space", "KeyJ"]); // once; then
if (game.input.action("fire").pressed) fire(); // .held .pressed .released
```

- Key names are `KeyboardEvent.code`: `'ArrowUp'`, `'KeyW'`, `'Space'`, `'Enter'`, `'Escape'`.
- Read input in a step. `pressed` is true for exactly one step, however short the press.
- The pointer is in screen pixels; `game.camera.toWorld(x, y)` gives world units once the camera moves.
- Swipes and taps: `const g = game.input.gestures('world', { onSwipe: e => turn(e.direction), onTap: e => tapAt(e.x, e.y) })`
  in a scene's `enter()`, and `g.cancel()` in its `exit()`.
- **Move and act through `game.controls`** rather than reading keys: `game.controls.axis('move')` reads the arrows,
  WASD and a gamepad's stick as one `{ x, y }`, and `game.controls.justPressed('fire')` (also `'action'`, `'pause'`)
  any key or button bound to it. `game.controls.bind('jump', { keys: ['Space'], pad: ['a'] })` adds an intent, and
  `players` in the manifest's `controls-2d` options gives two to four players their own keys and pads.
- **On a phone**, add `controls-touch`: a thumb stick and buttons that press key codes, bound beside the keys.
  ```json
  {
    "id": "controls-touch",
    "options": {
      "stick": {
        "codes": {
          "left": "Touch:left",
          "right": "Touch:right",
          "up": "Touch:up",
          "down": "Touch:down"
        }
      },
      "buttons": [{ "code": "Touch:fire", "label": "A" }]
    }
  }
  ```
  ```ts
  game.controls.bindMove({
    left: ["KeyA", "ArrowLeft", "Touch:left"],
    right: ["KeyD", "ArrowRight", "Touch:right"],
    up: ["KeyW", "ArrowUp", "Touch:up"],
    down: ["KeyS", "ArrowDown", "Touch:down"],
  });
  game.controls.bind("fire", {
    keys: ["Space", "KeyJ", "Touch:fire"],
    pad: ["a"],
  });
  ```
  The controls show only on a touch device.
- A gamepad: `const pad = game.input.gamepads[0]`, then `pad.connected`, `pad.axis('lx')` (`lx ly rx ry lt rt`, -1..1)
  and `pad.button('a')` (`a b x y lb rb lt rt back start up down left right`).
- Taps on a sprite: `pointer: { onTap: () => start(), onOver: e => { e.target.tint = '#ffd166'; } }` at spawn.

<!-- shared: every-step -->

## Every step

```ts
game.step("enemies", (dt) => {
  /* dt is the fixed step in seconds */
});
game.after(2, () => spawnBoss()); // once, in 2 seconds
const wave = game.every(0.5, spawnRock); // repeatedly; wave.cancel() stops it
game.rng.between(0, 10);
game.rng.int(1, 6);
game.rng.pick(list);
game.rng.chance(0.2);
```

Time is the game's: steps, timers and tweens all pause with it. Use `game.rng`, `game.after` and `game.every` for
chance and time, never `Math.random`, `setTimeout` or the clock. A step, a timer and a frame belong to the scene that
made them, and stop with it.
<!-- /shared: every-step -->

## Motion and juice

```ts
game.tween.to(
  coin,
  { y: coin.y - 40, alpha: 0 },
  { duration: 0.4, ease: "easeOutQuad", onComplete: () => coin.destroy() }
);
game.tween.to(
  banner,
  { scale: 1.2 },
  { duration: 0.3, yoyo: true, loop: true }
);
await game.tween.to(door, { x: 600 }); // a tween is awaitable
game.feel.shake(8, 0.3);
game.feel.flash("#ffffff", 0.2);
game.feel.hitstop(0.06);
game.feel.zoomPunch(0.1, 0.25);
game.particles.burst({
  x,
  y,
  count: 30,
  layer: "front",
  frame: "particle:spark",
  blend: "add",
  speed: [80, 220],
  lifespan: [0.3, 0.6],
  color: ["#fff3b0", "#ff7a00"],
}); // on every hit: no new object
```

Tweens move any number on anything: a sprite, a text, a sprite's `data`. A `burst` is a one-shot spray (aim it with
`angle` and `spread`, degrees); it keeps one emitter per recipe, so call it on every hit. Particle pictures:
`particle:disc`, `soft`, `flare`, `ring`, `star`, `spark`, `petal`, `square`, `pixel` and `smoke`, or a picture you
painted. For a flow, `game.particles.emitter({ follow: ship, offset, rate })`.

## Collisions

```ts
game.collide.on("bullet", "enemy", (b, e) => {
  b.destroy();
  e.destroy();
}); // every step they overlap
game.collide.solid("player", "wall"); // keep the player out of walls
game.spawn({
  id: "ball",
  texture: "ball",
  x,
  y,
  tags: ["ball"],
  collide: { shape: 0 },
}); // 0 circle, 1 box (default)
```

Shapes come from each sprite's size; `collide: { radius: 8 }` makes a circle smaller than its picture. Rules
belong to the scene that made them.

## Sound

```ts
game.sound.defineAll({
  jump: { type: "square", freq: 300, freqEnd: 600, duration: 0.1 },
  coin: { notes: [660, 880, 1320], duration: 0.18, type: "triangle" },
  tune: [
    {
      type: "square",
      tempo: 140,
      notes: "C4 E4 G4 C5 - G4 E4 C4",
      volume: 0.4,
    },
  ],
});
game.sound.play("jump");
const stop = game.sound.loop("tune");
game.sound.music("theme", { loop: true, fadeIn: 1 }); // a music file from assets.json
game.sound.volume("music", 0.5); // buses: 'master', 'music', 'sfx'
game.commands.mute();
game.commands.unmute(); // what the sound button does; game.sound.muted says which
```

<!-- shared: scenes -->

## Scenes

```ts
game.scenes.register({
  name: "play",
  enter() {
    /* build it */
  },
  exit() {
    /* rarely needed */
  },
});
game.scenes.go("play"); // replaces the scene
game.scenes.push("pause"); // the pause menu over it, 'play' held beneath; game.scenes.pop() resumes
```

Leaving a scene removes everything it made: sprites, text, graphics, backgrounds, steps, timers, tweens, collision rules and the camera's target.
So `go('play')` again is a clean restart, and nothing needs cleaning up by hand.

For a scene change that covers the screen (a fade, an iris, a wipe), add `transition` to the manifest and call
`game.transition.go('play', { kind: 'fade' })`; for a whole animated title screen as one data file, `title-screen`.
<!-- /shared: scenes -->

## Camera

```ts
game.rig.follow(player); // keep it in view as it moves
game.camera.bounds = { x: 0, y: 0, w: 4000, h: H }; // never show past the level's edges
game.camera.zoom = 1.5;
```

The camera starts centered on the screen. Sprites on world layers move with it; the HUD and text stay put.

<!-- shared: tail -->

## Saving

```ts
const best = game.save.read("best", 0);
game.save.write("best", Math.max(best, points));
```

## Buttons and menus

```ts
game.ui.theme = "candy"; // main.ts, once: the skin the manifest composes (ui-skin-candy)
game.ui.label({
  anchor: "center",
  y: -160,
  w: 640,
  h: 140,
  text: "Game over",
  style: "heading",
});
game.ui.button({
  anchor: "center",
  h: 96,
  text: "Play",
  style: "good",
  icon: "play",
  onClick: () => game.scenes.go("play"),
});
game.ui.pauseButton();
game.ui.muteButton(); // top right, round icon buttons: the pause menu, and the sound
game.ui.button({
  parent: menu,
  h: 64,
  text: "Restart",
  icon: "restart",
  onClick: () => game.scenes.go("play"),
});
```

`game.ui` has windows, panels, buttons, toggles, sliders and progress bars, laid out by anchors; its page in `docs/` has the
rest. A button shows one of the engine's icons with `icon`: `pause play sound-on sound-off music-on music-off restart
home settings close fullscreen fullscreen-exit back`, tinted with the button's text colour. A symbol on a button is
always an icon, never letters standing in for it ("II", "SND"). The skeleton's `Play.ts` already has the pause and
sound buttons, and `Pause.ts` the pause menu they open; when the design has its own art for them, `icon` takes the
picture's name. Widgets answer the keyboard and a gamepad as well as the pointer: Tab and the arrows move the focus,
Enter or Space presses.

**The menus wear a skin.** A new game's manifest composes `ui-skins` and one skin pack, `ui-skin-candy`, and
`main.ts` chooses it (`game.ui.theme = 'candy'`): every button, window and heading is a glossy game button on a lip
that presses down, with a chunky stroked caption. Style widgets with the skin's styles, never with style data of
your own: `style: 'good'` for the way into play, `'warn'`, `'bad'`, `'flat'` or a colour name (`'orange'`, `'pink'`,
`'blue'`…) for the others, `'icon'` for a round icon button, `'heading'` for a title, which grows with its height
and shrinks to its width. Never give a button a width: without one it fits its icon and caption, and in a column
that stretches it (`align: 'stretch'`) it shrinks them to fit. Recolour the skin with its pack's options in the
manifest, `{ "id": "ui-skin-candy", "options": { "color": "pink", "radius": 18 } }` (`color`, `surface`, `radius`,
`depth`, `roles`, `colors`), or live with `game.skins.use({ material: 'candy', color: 'pink' })`. For another look,
put another skin pack in its place: `ui-skin-jelly`, `-glossy`, `-bubble`, `-block`, `-cartoon`, `-wood`,
`-timber`, `-metal`, `-bezel` or `-candystripe`, and choose its name. Compose one: a game carries every skin it
composes. Their pages in `docs/` have the rest. A speech box that matches the skin is `dialogue`
(`game.dialogue.open({ lines })`), and a framed picture that stretches without blurring its corners is `nine-slice`.

## Bars and meters

A game's health, timers, XP, ammo, loading and cooldowns are the `bars` pack: add `{ "id": "bars" }` to the
manifest. One call makes a styled bar; set its value and it animates there.

```ts
const hp = game.bars.create({
  anchor: "top-left",
  x: 16,
  y: 16,
  width: 240,
  height: 22,
  max: 100,
  label: "{value}/{max}",
});
hp.value -= 10; // eases there; ghost: true leaves a chunk that drains, as in a fighting game
const time = game.bars.create({
  shape: "ring",
  anchor: "top",
  y: 12,
  width: 72,
  max: 60,
  label: "{time}", // top right is the pause button's
  zones: [{ below: 0.2, fill: "#ff3b30", pulse: 2 }],
});
time.to(0, 60, () => endRound()); // a countdown that turns red and pulses at the end
const enemyHp = game.bars.create({
  follow: enemy,
  style: "flat",
  width: 40,
  height: 6,
  ghost: true,
}); // rides above it, dies with it
```

Ten styles (`style: 'glossy' | 'neon' | 'blocks' | 'fighter' …`), any colour or gradient, segments, glow, stripes,
labels inside, outside or riding the fill. Use `bars` for a game's meters, never `game.ui.progress` (a
menu widget) or rectangles; its page in `docs/` has the rest.

## Debug controls

```ts
game.cheats.add({
  name: "level",
  does: "Start at level n",
  args: "n",
  run: (n) => {
    startAt(Number(n));
    return `level ${n}`;
  },
});
game.inspect.state(() => run); // the run's state, for whoever checks the game
```

Add them once in `debug.ts`: a jump to any level or screen, a power-up, win or lose now. A jump starts the game
as a player would find it there.
<!-- /shared: tail -->

## The rules

- No `document`, `window`, `Math.random`, `setTimeout` or `Date.now`: the engine gives each of them.
- One picture per name; paint it before a sprite shows it.
- Keep a thing's state on it (`data`), and find things by tag.
- Add a pack to the manifest for what this page does not cover, and its page appears in `docs/` when the game is
  baked: HUD bars and meters (`bars`), physics (`physics-2d`), tile maps (`tiles-2d`), 2D lights (`lighting-2d`), post
  effects (`post` and `post-*`, a colour grade with `post-grade`), shaders on sprites (`sprite-shaders`), a speech box
  (`dialogue`), framed panels (`nine-slice`), video (`video`), scene covers (`transition`), a whole title screen
  (`title-screen`), a genre's rules (a platformer, a match-3, a shooter). The catalogue lists every pack with what it
  is for: search it before writing a mechanic yourself.
